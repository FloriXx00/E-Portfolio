📄 English E-Portfolio – README

This is an interactive personal e-portfolio created as part of my English course project.

▶ HOW TO OPEN:
Simply double-click on the file called `index.html` or open it in your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave, etc.).

⚠️ IMPORTANT for Brave users:
If you're using the Brave browser, make sure to **disable the Shields (ad-blocker)** for this site – otherwise, some JavaScript-based features might not work properly (e.g., animations or sliders).

🌐 STRUCTURE OF THE PAGE:
The portfolio is structured as a rotating 3D cube with multiple sections:
- **About Me** – basic introduction and educational background
- **Goals** – my English learning objectives
- **Weekly Updates** – summaries of articles read each week
- **Additional Tasks** – grammar exercises, translations, etc.

✨ BONUS:
There's a hidden **easter egg** in the bottom-left corner 🧪 – click the glowing pen icon to reveal experimental network controls. Have fun tweaking the visual effect!

🎓 Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS – no external frameworks – fully lightweight and offline-friendly.

Enjoy!
